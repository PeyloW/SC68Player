 * See NSSortDescriptor for additional information.

 * @param anObject The object to add to the receiver's content. This value must not be nil.
 * @param descriptors An array of NSSortDescriptor objects.
 * @result The index where anObject has been inserted.

 * @param anObject The object to add to the receiver's content. This value must not be nil.
 * @param comparator A selector that specifies the comparison method to use to compare elements in the receiver.
